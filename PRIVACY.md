# Privacy Policy for the security.txt Browser Extension

Last updated: July 8, 2020

We will never access or transmit your personal data, upload, or open any local files unless it is at your request or by your own design when involving a Harmless Systems product feature or service agreement.

## Data Collection

The security.txt Browser extension does not collect or access any of your personal data, collect analytics, or attempt to identify users. We do not load any remote code.

Note that you may interact with other third-party providers such as internet service providers, source code and browser extension repositories, and search engines before downloading the browser extension. These providers will have their own privacy policies and should be consulted as needed. Some of the most common privacy policies have been linked below for convenience but are not exhaustive or authoritative:

- Chrome Web Store: [Google Privacy and Terms as linked from chrome.google.com](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en)
- Microsoft Edge Add-ons: [Microsoft Privacy Statement as linked from microsoftedge.microsoft.com](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839)
- Firefox Add-ons: [Mozilla Privacy, as linked from addons.mozilla.org](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/websites/)
- Opera Addons: [Opera Privacy Statement as linked from addons.opera.com](https://www.opera.com/privacy)
- Github (issues, source control, releases): [GitHub Privacy Statement as linked from github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement)

## Identity & Access

We’ll never sell your personal info to third parties, and we won’t use your name or company in marketing statements.

When you write Harmless Systems with a question or to ask for help, we'll keep that correspondence and the email address for future reference. We also store any information you volunteer, like surveys, for as long as it makes sense.

The only times we’ll ever share your info:

- To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.

## Law Enforcement

Harmless Systems won’t hand your data over to law enforcement unless a court order says we have to. We flat-out reject requests from local and federal law enforcement when they seek data without a court order. And unless we're legally prevented from it, we’ll always inform you when such requests are made.

## Changes & Questions

Harmless Systems may update this policy as needed, albeit infrequently — we’ll notify you about significant changes by updating the privacy policy on our website and in source control. You can access, change, or delete your personal information at any time by contacting us at [info@harmless.systems](mailto:info@harmless.systems). Reach out to us with any questions you may have about this policy or your data and we’ll be happy to answer them!
